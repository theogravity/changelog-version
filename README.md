[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

Creates / updates a changelog with customizable options, including version / timestamp / CI support.

## What it offers

- Changelog file name
- Where to find your version data
- What your `unreleased` text for replacement should be (eg `[UNRELEASED]`, `*version*`, etc)
- What your release tag should look like (via the `{date}`, `{version}` tags)
- Date formatting via the [`dateformat`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dateformat) library
- Use a custom config file with additional callback handlers
- Helper command included to create a changelog file + stamp it with the `unreleased` text
- Examples on how to auto-increment your logs and publish to npm in your CI

Turn this (the format can be customized):

```
# Changelog

## [UNRELEASED]

- I have a change!
```

into this:

```
# Changelog

## 1.2.3 - Wed May 04 2016 04:27:29

- I have a change!
```

## What it will not do

- Version bumping `package.json`. [`version-bump`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@theo.gravity/version-bump) can do that job.
Your `package.json` file must have the new version you want to stamp the changelog with before running
`changelog-version release`.
- Commit changes to your VCS.

## Custom configuration file

To spare yourself from having to specify command line options each time, you can use a custom config file.

Place `.changelog.js` in the root of your project.

(The file name can be configured with the `--configFile` option, which is relative to `--projectRoot`.)

If detected, `changelog-version` will derive options from this file.

With the exception of `projectRoot`, options defined on the command line will take
precedence.

```js
// This is an optional configuration file
// you can use with changelog-version.
// If specified, any command line args has priority over the
// values returned in this file.

// All values are optional.
// Do not use the ES6 export default
// since the file is imported using require()
// See command line options for additional available properties
module.exports = {
  /**
   * This is called before doing the version stamping.
   * @returns {Promise<void>}
   */
  onBeforeRelease: async () => {},
  /**
   * This is called after the version stamping is complete.
   * @param {string} version Release version that the changelog stamp used
   * @param {string} date Formatted date that the changelog stamp used
   * @param {string} releaseStamp Release text that the changelog was stamped with
   * @returns {Promise<void>}
   */
  onAfterRelease: async ({ version, date, releaseStamp } = {}) => {},

  // Values can either be text
  // or a (async) function that returns text

  // ==== Common options ====
  // If specified here, this will have priority
  // over the command line option projectRoot
  // once this file is read.
  projectRoot: () => {
    return process.cwd()
  },
  changelogFile: () => {
    return 'CHANGELOG.md'
  },
  // ==== Options specific to prepare ====
  newUnreleasedText: '# UNRELEASED\n\n',

  // ==== Options specific to release ====
  packageFile: async () => {
    return 'package.json'
  },
  // see https://www.npmjs.com/package/dateformat
  // for options
  dateFormat: 'default',
  unreleasedTag: () => {
    return 'UNRELEASED'
  },
  unreleasedTagFormat: '{date} - {version}'
}
```

### Additional properties

Aside from the command line options, the config file offers additional properties:

#### Release properties

##### `async onBeforeRelease`

Called before the release. Use this to do any pre-setup that you need to do.

##### `async onAfterRelease({ version, date, releaseStamp })`

Called after the changelog has been updated.

```
   * @param {string} version Release version that the changelog stamp used
   * @param {string} date Formatted date that the changelog stamp used
   * @param {string} releaseStamp Release text that the changelog was stamped with
```

## API

- See `src` for the API.
- See the `test` directory for API usage samples.

## CI Integration

### Auto-versioning + publishing in your CI

Make sure you have `changelog-version`.

Install:

- [version-bump](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@theo.gravity/version-bump)
- [version-bump-plugin-git](https://github.com/theogravity/version-bump-plugin-git)

`npm install @theo.gravity/version-bump @theo.gravity/changelog-version version-bump-plugin-git --dev`

#### CircleCI

This repo uses CircleCI to automatically version stamp the `CHANGELOG.md` file and
publish to npm with the new version.

See the `.circleci/` directory for auto release log stamping, version bumping and npm publishing.

The following `package.json` script is used in conjunction with the CircleCI flow:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
      "release-log": "changelog-version release",
      "prepare-publish": "version-bump git-commit-msg && npm run release-log"
  }
}
```
